                    Only a single active brokerage session can exist for any username accross all IBKR services. 
                    If you are logged in to either Client Portal, TWS, or IBKR Mobile, make sure to log out and try reauthenticating your session Client Portal API again. 
                    The endpoint <b>/reauthenticate</b> can be used to reauthenticate the brokerage session.

                    The maximum amount of time that the Client Portal API session can remain authenticated is 24 hours. 
                    After this time, clients will need to reauthenticate their session by following the instructions on the <a href='./quickstart'>Quickstart</a> page.
                    In addition, the session will time out if no requests are received within a span of 5 minutes. 
                    In order to prevent this from happening, you can use the <b>/sso/validate</b> endpoint can be called on a regular basis. It is recommended to call this endpoint approximately every minute.

                    Clients wishing to use multiple IBKR products at the same time (TWS, IBKR Mobile or Client Portal) can do so by creating a new username 
                    that can then be used to log into other services while using the Client Portal API. 
                    To create a second username please see the following <a href="https://ibkr.info/node/1004" target="_blank">article</a>.

                    Since the login process to the Client Portal API is the same as that for Client Portal, which has access to sensitve data such as funds and banking, it is

                    For security reasons, automated login to Client Portal API is not currently supported for individual clients. The API gateway was designed to require
                    the end user to manually enter their credentials into a web browser to authenticate their brokerage session.

                <p>
                    Since the gateway is running on your premises, the certificate needs to be created and self-signed by you, or offically signed by a trusted third-party. 
                    The gateway is similar to other webservers, such as Tomcat, which doesn't provide a certificate along with the release. To fix this issue, 
                    please see the certificate generation steps below:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Create a self-signed certificate by following the following <a href="https://www.sslshopper.com/article-how-to-create-a-self-signed-certificate-using-java-keytool.html">guide</a>.</li>     
                        <li>Place the generated *.jks certificate file in the 'root' folder in the gateway directory.</li>
                        <li>Update the sslCert field in the gateway configuration file with the details of the generated certificate</li>
                        <li>Restart the gateway</li>

                    Where this limit is exceeded, the API will return a "429 Too Many Requests" exception. Violator IP addresses are put in a penalty box for 10 minutes.
                    After this period, the IP address is removed from the penalty box until another request exceeds the limit again.
